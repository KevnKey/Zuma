tp0
Added colored circles and shoots in the direction of the cursor on click. Deletes balls when
they fly outside the screen.
tp1
Added a frog that always looks in the direction of the cursor. Implemented Voronoi noise for
the background and added balls that move along a straight path.
tp2
Added collision detection. When a shot ball hits the path of balls, it either inserts or it
destroys some balls. Balls travel along a parametrized ellipse path.
tp3
Added home screen with play and rules buttons. Made the balls insert in the right place when
collide. Made ball eliminations possible as long as the same-colored balls are close to each
other even though they are on different layers of the path. Added ball sprites to substitute
colored circles. Added game over and win screen. Able to restart game. Added indicator for the
next ball color that will be fired. Added blue spiral of doom. Added command keys.
